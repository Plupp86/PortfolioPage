            <h2>My story as a developer</h2>
       <p>After five years working offshore in the oil and gas industry
            I took a programming course in C#.NET during the spring of 2018 in
            order to complement my masters degree in Engeneering Physics. This
            gives me a good combination of problem solving and physiscs knowledge
            combined with understanding of programming and software development.
            My experience working with co-workers from all over the world and with
            a wide range of educational background, together with my theoretical
            education, makes me a valuable asset in many different areas. I am also
            a quick learner and good at adopting to new situations.
